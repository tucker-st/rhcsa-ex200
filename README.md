# RHCSA (EX200) Practice Repository - RHEL 10

Hands-on RHCSA exam preparation, VM labs, and on-the-job Linux administration reference.

This repository provides a practical, exam-aligned study framework for the
Red Hat Certified System Administrator (RHCSA - EX200) exam, updated for RHEL 10.

---

## Repository Purpose

This project is intended to:

- Provide hands-on practice aligned to official EX200 objectives
- Support VM-based, exam-style lab work
- Reinforce persistence, validation, and correctness
- Serve as a practical Linux administration reference

---

## Official Exam Reference

- Exam: RHCSA (EX200)
- Operating System: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 10
- Exam format: Performance-based, hands-on

## Scope of This Repository

Covered topics include:

- Essential Linux commands
- User and group management
- Permissions and ownership
- Storage management (LVM, XFS)
- Networking using nmcli
- System services and boot targets
- Firewall configuration using firewalld

## VM Lab Environment

Recommended setup:

- Hypervisor: KVM, VMware, VirtualBox, or Proxmox
- OS: RHEL 10 or compatible rebuild
- VM count: 1 (exam-style) or 2 (client/server practice)
- Resources:
  - 2 vCPU
  - 4 GB RAM
  - 30 to 40 GB disk

Root or sudo access is required.

---

## Exam-Style Lab Workflow

1. Snapshot or reset the VM
2. Read the lab objective only
3. Perform tasks without notes
4. Reboot the system
5. Validate all results
6. Self-grade using the checklist

Rule:
If it does not survive reboot, it does not count.

---

## Containers (EX200 Reminder)

RHCSA tests basic Podman usage only:

- Running containers
- Inspecting containers
- Port mapping
- Volume mounts with SELinux
- Persisting containers using systemd

Kubernetes and orchestration platforms are not tested.
